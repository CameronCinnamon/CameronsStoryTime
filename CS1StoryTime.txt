## My Story
One sunny morning I was walking to class in the CPP building when I happened upon a stray cat. 
Although the cat was black and white, his personality was much more colorful. 
For reasons that are still a mystery to this very day, I had the remnants of a chicken strip in my pocket.
Upon realizing this, my mind was made up. I had decided to befriend the feline with the assistance of pocket-lint-chicken.
The cat accepted my friend request and we are still in touch to this day.
