# Cameron Cinnamon Class Goals

I'll start off by saying that I enrolled in this class because it is required for B.A. Engineering Physics. 
Next, I'll add that this is far more challenging and exciting than the high school computer science (microsoft
word) classes that I took. I do not intend to waste my time in this class. I want to gain computer literacy as 
well as a better understanding of the languages our computers speak and the ways we can talk to them.
