# Cameron and Josh Story 

The cat no longer likes to be fed people food. 

## Cameron's Contributions

My room-mate, whom I met yesturday, is curruenty standing in my closet trying to feed his television cable throught the port.

## Josh's Contributions

I made a branch here on Cameron's repo. Feels weird to be operating inside someone elses repository. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time.
